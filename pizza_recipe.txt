How to Make Pizza

Making pizza at home is fun and rewarding. Here is a simple step-by-step guide to making a classic homemade pizza from scratch.

Ingredients:
- 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (one packet)
- 1 1/2 cups warm water (about 110°F / 45°C)
- 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup pizza sauce (store-bought or homemade)
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- Toppings of your choice (pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, olives, etc.)

Steps:

1. Prepare the Dough:
   - In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.
   - Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the flour.
   - Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
   - Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a cloth, and let rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until doubled in size.

2. Preheat Oven:
   - Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat.

3. Shape the Dough:
   - Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two equal portions.
   - Roll out each portion on a floured surface into a 12-inch circle.
   - Transfer dough to a baking sheet or pizza peel if using a stone.

4. Add Sauce and Toppings:
   - Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.
   - Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.
   - Add your favorite toppings evenly on top.

5. Bake the Pizza:
   - Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.

6. Serve:
   - Remove pizza from oven, let it cool for a few minutes.
   - Slice and serve hot.

Tips:
- Use a pizza stone for a crispier crust.
- Don’t overload with toppings to avoid soggy pizza.
- Experiment with different cheeses and herbs like basil or oregano for extra flavor.

Enjoy your homemade delicious pizza!
